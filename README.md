# Web site for Brown Bros. Air Conditioning & Heating Sales & Service

---

Current status is a collection of static HTML files, with `php` extensions.

If the `.htaccess` file is disabled, the links will work, otherwise they will not. This is a temporary condition while the static HTML is being converted to dynamic PHP.

Intentions are to use PHP to serve the pages with common content merged with the page specific content. Some pages will become more _dynamic_ in nature, and the navication menu will be modified for each page as needed.

The site will grow a minimal amount, although the content will increase, and be refined over time.

## TODO

- Develop a 'Home" page rather than using the current flyer
- Convert to PHP operations
- Customize `<META>` tags for each file
- Create a method for site owner to add content to informational pages
- Dynamically generate informational pages from owner-created content
- Implement the planned message sending from the Contat Us page.
- An archive of past flyers (?possibly)
- Add a testimonials page (?possibly)
- Add a guestbook (?possibly)
